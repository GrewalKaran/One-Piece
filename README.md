# One-Piece
This my first project using flexbox in css ansd html.This project is a part 
of The-Oden-Project fundamental's of web-development course.
This is my take on - the project that The-Oden-Project course asked me to do.
And I really appreciate that TOP (abbreviation) allows you to personalize your
project and TOP also has lot less hand-holding as compared to other online
courses like codeacademy and freecodecamp.
