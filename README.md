# One-Piece
This my first landing page using flexbox in css ansd html.
This project is part of The-Oden-Project's fundamental course of web-development.
This is my take on - the project that The-Oden-Project course asked me to do.
And I really appreciate that TOP (abbreviation) allows you to personalize your project and TOP also has lot less hand-holding as compared to other onlinecourses like codeacademy and freecodecamp.
